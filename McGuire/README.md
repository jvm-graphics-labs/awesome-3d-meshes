Researchers are evaluated by counting citations. To support McGuire work maintaining his archive and 
make your work reproducible, please cite the archive in your publications as:

    [McGuire2017] Morgan McGuire, Computer Graphics Archive, July 2017 (https://casual-effects.com/data) 

This page gives citation source code that you can copy and paste for various typesetting systems, such as BibTeX.

All meshes are packaged as zip files using OBJ and PNG to simplify loading in a research and 
prototyping environment. McGuire and his collaborators have converted most of these models from their original formats and corrected geometry and texture errors.
